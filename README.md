WebSocketsImplementation
========================

A C# WebSocket Implementation (version 0.0.1)

I Uploaded this code mostly due to the lack of examples.
This Library is NOT stable. Its a mere guideline but
will progress further. Also, its my exploration Project
for TPL (Task Paralel Library).

ToDo's (not implemented):
* write comments
* document code
* receive unencrypted messages
* send messages to a client encrypted & unencrypted
* unit tests
